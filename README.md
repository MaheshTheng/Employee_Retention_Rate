# Employee Retention Rate
This project give the information abou the different types of Machine Learnig algorithm used for Classificatio. It contain the dataset of employee wether it leave the company or not. By using the machine learnig algorithm predict that the employee will remain in the company or not according to some information about it which are given below<pre>
    <br>1)satisfaction_level       Level of satisfaction {0â€“1}.
    <br>2)last_evaluation          Time since last performance evaluation (in years).
    <br>3)number_project           Number of projects completed while at work.
