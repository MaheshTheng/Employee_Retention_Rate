# Employee Retention Rate
This project give the information about the different types of Machine Learnig algorithms used for Classification by compareing them by making confusion matrix, by claculating mean and devition or by ploting Receiver Operating Characteristic(ROC) curve and there accuracy. It contain the dataset of employee wether it leave the company or not. By using the machine learnig algorithm predict that the employee will remain in the company or not according to some information about it which are
<pre><br>1)satisfaction_level       Level of satisfaction {0â€“1}.
    <br>2)last_evaluation          Time since last performance evaluation (in years).
    <br>3)number_project           Number of projects completed while at work.
    <br>4)average_montly_hours     Average monthly hours at workplace.
    <br>5)time_spend_company       Number of years spent in the company.
    <br>6)Work_accident            Whether the employee had a workplace accident.
    <br>7)promotion_last_5years    Whether the employee was promoted in the last five years.</pre>
    
Given below the different types of clssification algorithm which are use for clssification:
<pre><br>1)Random Forestn classifier
    <br>2)Gradient Boosting Classifier
    <br>3)K-Nearest Neighbors
    <br>4)Support Vector Machine (SVM)
    <br>5)Logistic Regression</pre>
