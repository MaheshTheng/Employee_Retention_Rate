# Employee Retention Rate
This project give the information abou the different algorith used in Machine Learnig for Classification. It give the information about the employee wether it leave the company or not according to the different parameter which are given below
    <br>1)satisfaction_level       Level of satisfaction {0â€“1}.
    <br>2)last_evaluation          Time since last performance evaluation (in years).
    <br>3)number_project           Number of projects completed while at work.
    <br>4)average_montly_hours     Average monthly hours at workplace.
    <br>5)time_spend_company       Number of years spent in the company.

    <br>7)promotion_last_5years    Whether the employee was promoted in the last five years.<l>
    
Here, I used different types of clssification algorithm which are given below clssifier:
    <br>1)Random Forestn classifier
    <br>2)Gradient Boosting Classifier
    <br>3)K-Nearest Neighbors
    <br>4)Support Vector Machine (SVM)
    <br>5)Logistic Regression
